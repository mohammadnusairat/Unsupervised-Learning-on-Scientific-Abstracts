# Unsupervised-Learning-on-Scientific-Abstracts
This project applies unsupervised machine learning techniques to a dataset of 5,000 scientific abstracts, with the goal of extracting meaningful patterns and topics from unstructured text data. The process includes natural language processing, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, and clustering.
